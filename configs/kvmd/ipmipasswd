# This file describes the credentials for IPMI users. The first pair separated by colon
# is the login and password with which the user can access to IPMI. The second pair
# is the name and password with which the user can access to KVMD API. The arrow is used
# as a separator and shows the direction of user registration in the system.
#
# WARNING! IPMI protocol is completely unsafe by design. In short, the authentication
# process for IPMI 2.0 mandates that the server send a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the
# requested user's password to the client, prior to the client authenticating. Never use
# the same passwords for KVMD and IPMI users. This default configuration is shown here
# for example only.
#
# And even better not to use IPMI. Instead, you can directly use KVMD API via curl.
