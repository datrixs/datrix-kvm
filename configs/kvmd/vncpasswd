# This file describes the credentials for VNCAuth. The left part before arrow is a passphrase
# for VNCAuth. The right part is username and password with which the user can access to KVMD API.
# The arrow is used as a separator and shows the relationship of user registrations on the system.
#
# Never use the same passwords for VNC and IPMI users. This default configuration is shown here
# for example only.
#
# If this file does not contain any entries, VNCAuth will be disabled and you will only be able
# to login in using your KVMD username and password using VeNCrypt methods.
